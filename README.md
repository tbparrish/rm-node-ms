# RouteMatch Node Micro-Service

RouteMatch Node Micro-Service is a self-contained micro-service library framework used to help with writing maintainable JavaScript micro-services.

## Features

- Seneca lets you build message based micro-service systems with ease. You donâ€™t need to know where the other services are located, how many of them there are, or what they do. Everything external to your business logic - such as databases, caches and third-party integrations - is likewise hidden behind micro-services.
- RabbitMQ and EventEmitter transports behind a standard interface
- Configuration by sensible defaults, project file
- Connecting to an Monogo DB backend
